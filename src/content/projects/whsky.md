Recently, I've been getting into whiskey. Not an addiction or dependence, but an appreciation for
the flavors, mouthfeel, and history of these spirits. I had a similar journey with coffee when I
was in college. I had various apps and processes to log my discoveries: what tasting notes I
experienced, what countries and regions I liked, and how the drying and roasting processes affected
the flavor of the cup. I've searched for an Android app to help with tracking my progress and
learnings, but so far, I haven't found anything besides using a notes app.

So I decided to try my hand at it. It's called WHSKY, and it will be in the same vein as
[Untappd](https://untappd.com/) for beer or [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com/). The basic MVP will
start with spirit tracking, with popular whiskeys and spirits, stored locally and in the cloud.
